## SLIDE 1: Problem

### Prompt:

```
Create a presentation slide with a cream (#F7F4EA) background. 16:9 aspect ratio.

Title at the top in large Modak font, near-black (#1A1A1A): "3 Problems with Reviews in Korea"

Below the title, show 3 problem cards arranged horizontally, each on a blush pink (#EBD9D1) rounded card with subtle shadow:

CARD 1 - Icon: a robot/bot icon in red at the top
- Header in near-black bold: "Can We Trust Reviews?"
- Body text in sage deep (#778873): "Reviews are easily botted and manipulated. Fake 5-star reviews, competitor sabotage — no way to know what's real."
- Small visual: a fake review card with "BOT" red badge and 5 yellow stars

CARD 2 - Icon: a globe with question mark in brown (#B87C4C) at the top
- Header in near-black bold: "Not Built for Foreigners"
- Body text in sage deep (#778873): "Foreigner-friendly places, English menus, global ATMs — this specific info is nearly impossible to find on Google or Naver."
- Small visual: a search bar with "english menu near me" and "0 results"

CARD 3 - Icon: a map pin with people icon in sage green (#A8BBA3) at the top
- Header in near-black bold: "No Community for Foreigners"
- Body text in sage deep (#778873): "No neighborhood-specific community app for foreigners living in Korea. Info is scattered across Facebook groups, Reddit, and word of mouth."
- Small visual: scattered logos of Facebook, Reddit, Google with broken connection lines between them

Bottom-right corner: small Masil logo in sage green (#A8BBA3)

Style: clean, minimal, 3-column layout. Each card is equal size. Icons are simple and flat. Rounded corners (16px). Plenty of white space. The 3 cards should feel like 3 distinct pain points at a glance.
```

**ADD MANUALLY:** Your Masil logo in the bottom-right corner.

## SLIDE 2: Solution

### Prompt:

```
Create a presentation slide with a cream (#F7F4EA) background. 16:9 aspect ratio.

Title at top in large Modak font, near-black (#1A1A1A): "Masil — Reviews you can actually trust"

Subtitle in sage deep (#778873): "GPS-verified reviews by World ID-verified humans, built for foreigners in Korea"

CENTER - Show a vertical flow diagram depicting the entire user journey, flowing top-to-bottom or left-to-right:

STEP 1 - Rounded box on blush pink (#EBD9D1):
- Icon: World ID orb/globe in sage green (#A8BBA3)
- Label: "Verify with World ID" in bold

STEP 4 - Rounded box on sage green (#A8BBA3), text in white:

- "Don't have World ID?"
- "Pay $0.10 USDC for view-only access"
- "This payment is redistributed to helpful reviewers"
- Styled as a secondary/aside element, not the main flow

Below the flow, a small phone mockup preview of the Masil map. Keep subtle, positioned bottom-right.

Style: clean, the flow diagram is the hero. Arrows are smooth and curved in sage soft (#D2DCB6). Each step box has subtle shadow. Rounded corners (16px).
```

## SLIDE 3: Why World ID is Essential

### Prompt:

```
Create a presentation slide with a cream (#F7F4EA) background.

Title at top in large Modak font, near-black (#1A1A1A): "Without World ID, this doesn't work"

CENTER - Show a comparison table with two columns:

LEFT COLUMN header: "Without World ID" on a light red/coral tinted background (#F5E0E0)
RIGHT COLUMN header: "With World ID" on a sage light (#F1F3E0) background

4 rows in the table:

Row 1:
- Left (with red X icon): "Bots create thousands of fake reviews"
- Right (with green checkmark icon in #A1BC98): "One human = one account"

Row 2:
- Left (with red X icon): "Shop owners write fake 5-star reviews"
- Right (with green checkmark icon): "Every reviewer is accountable"

Row 3:
- Left (with red X icon): "Competitors post fake negative reviews"
- Right (with green checkmark icon): "Trust Score tracks reputation"

Row 4:
- Left (with red X icon): "No consequences for lying"
- Right (with green checkmark icon): "Future: economic slashing"

Table style: rounded corners, clean borders in sage soft (#D2DCB6). Alternating row backgrounds very subtle. Icons are simple circles with X or checkmark inside.

Below the table, a highlighted callout box with brown (#B87C4C) left border on blush pink (#EBD9D1) background:
"World ID isn't a login method. It's the core infrastructure that makes trusted reviews possible."
Text in near-black (#1A1A1A), bold.

Style: the contrast between red-tinted left and green-tinted right should be clear but not harsh. Keep the overall warm, minimal aesthetic.
```

**ADD MANUALLY:** Nothing needed — this slide is self-contained.

"Every review is GPS-verified at the location and tied to a unique World ID"

Style: the 4 phones should be evenly spaced and feel like a journey/flow. Clean, not crowded. Phone frames should be thin and modern.
```

**ADD MANUALLY:** Replace the 4 placeholder phone screens with these actual screenshots:
1. `docs/frotend/screenshot/screenshot-splash.png` — Auth/splash screen with Masil logo

## SLIDE 5: Privacy & Anti-Abuse

### Prompt:

```
Create a presentation slide with a cream (#F7F4EA) background.

Title at top in large Modak font, near-black (#1A1A1A): "Privacy-first, abuse-resistant"

Layout: Two sections side by side.

LEFT SECTION - "Data Minimization" header in sage green (#A8BBA3) bold

Show a vertical list with icons:

✗ (red) "No real names"
✗ (red) "No email addresses"
✗ (red) "No personal information"
✗ (red) "No cross-app tracking"

Then a divider line in sage soft (#D2DCB6)

✓ (green #A1BC98) "Nullifier hash (anonymous unique ID)"
✓ (green #A1BC98) "Review content (user-written)"
✓ (green #A1BC98) "GPS coordinates (only at review time)"

The ✗ items should feel clearly "we don't do this" and ✓ items should feel "only the minimum needed"

RIGHT SECTION - "Anti-Abuse Defense" header in brown (#B87C4C) bold

Show 3 stacked defense cards with rounded corners on blush pink (#EBD9D1) background:

Card 1: Shield icon in sage green
- "Sybil Attack" (bold) → "World ID: 1 human = 1 account"

Card 2: Location pin icon in sage green
- "Fake Location" (bold) → "GPS: must be within 50m"

Card 3: Star/score icon in sage green
- "Bad Reviews" (bold) → "Trust Score: reputation matters"

Below both sections, a bottom banner spanning full width on sage light (#F1F3E0) background with rounded corners:
Text in near-black: "World ID uses zero-knowledge proofs — we verify you're human without knowing who you are"

Style: clean two-column layout. Cards have subtle shadows. Icons are simple and flat. The "what we don't collect" section should visually feel like things being crossed out / rejected.
```

**ADD MANUALLY:** Nothing needed — this slide is self-contained.
