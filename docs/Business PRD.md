# Masil - Business PRD

## Executive Summary

**Masil** (마실) is a trusted neighborhood review platform for foreigners living in Korea, built as a World Mini App. By combining GPS-verified presence with World ID's proof-of-personhood, Masil creates the first review platform where every review is written by a verified human who was actually there.

---

## The Name: Masil (마실)

### Meaning
"마실" is a traditional Korean word meaning "a casual stroll to a neighbor's house" - the act of wandering your neighborhood to connect with your community.

### Why It Works
- **Authentic Korean heritage** - Shows respect for local culture
- **Community-focused meaning** - Aligns with neighborhood discovery
- **Memorable and unique** - No direct competitors with this name
- **Conversation starter** - Foreigners will ask "what does Masil mean?" creating organic word-of-mouth

### Tagline Options
- "Masil - Walk your neighborhood, trust your neighbors"
- "Masil - Reviews from humans who were actually there"
- "Masil - Your neighborhood, verified"

## Motivation & Problem

### The Core Insight

> "Most SaaS can be built by yourself. But two things can't be easily replicated: offline experiences and private community data."

### The Problem for Foreigners in Korea

Korea is amazing, but navigating it as a foreigner is hard:

| Pain Point | Example |
|------------|---------|
| **Language barrier** | Menus only in Korean, staff can't communicate |
| **Hidden knowledge** | "This ATM doesn't work with foreign cards" |
| **Cultural friction** | Some places are foreigner-friendly, some aren't |
| **Unreliable reviews** | Google reviews are sparse, Naver is in Korean, both can be manipulated |
| **No community** | No dedicated space for foreigners to share local knowledge |

### Why Existing Solutions Fail

| Platform | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **Google Maps** | Reviews can be botted, no verification, not Korea-focused |
| **Naver Maps** | All in Korean, designed for Koreans |
| **Expat Facebook Groups** | Unstructured, hard to search, info gets buried |
| **Reddit r/korea** | Not location-specific, general Q&A |
| **MangoPlate** | Restaurant-only, Korean-focused |

### The Trust Problem

Reviews are inherently gameable:
- Shop owners create fake positive reviews
- Competitors create fake negative reviews
- Bots scale this manipulation
- No accountability = no trust

**You can't verify if a review is "correct," but you can verify:**
1. The reviewer is a real human (World ID)
2. The reviewer was actually there (GPS)
3. The reviewer faces consequences for bad behavior (Trust Score → future slashing)

## Solution Narrative

### The Story

Imagine Sarah, an American English teacher who just moved to Jongno-gu. She wants to:
- Find a cafe where she can work remotely with good WiFi
- Know which convenience store clerk is friendly to foreigners
- Discover which ATM actually accepts her US debit card
- Avoid restaurants that charge "foreigner prices"

Today, Sarah has to:
1. Ask in scattered Facebook groups
2. Hope someone replies
3. Get conflicting answers
4. Try places blind and waste time/money

**With Masil:**
1. Sarah opens the app, verifies with World ID
2. She sees a map of Jongno-gu with pins
3. Each pin shows reviews from verified humans who were there
4. She filters by "Global ATM" tag and finds the nearest one
5. After using it, she leaves a review while standing there
6. Her review helps the next foreigner

### The Virtuous Cycle

```
More verified users
       ↓
More GPS-verified reviews
       ↓
More valuable local knowledge
       ↓
More foreigners attracted
       ↓
Network effects compound
       ↓
Becomes THE trusted source
```

## Why World ID + GPS = Breakthrough

### World ID Solves Identity

| Problem | World ID Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| Bots creating fake reviews | Only verified humans can post |
| One person, many accounts | One Orb verification = one account |
| No accountability | Nullifier hash tracks user across actions |
| Anonymous trolling | Economic consequences coming (slashing) |

### GPS Solves Presence

| Problem | GPS Solution |
|---------|--------------|
| Fake reviews from non-visitors | Must be within 50m to post |
| Competitors sabotaging | Hard to fake presence + identity together |
| Outdated information | Recent presence = recent info |

### The Combination is Unique

No other platform has:
- Proof of personhood (World ID)
- Proof of presence (GPS)
- Economic accountability (Trust Score → Slashing)

This makes Masil **the first review platform where you can actually trust the reviews.**

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
*None* - No existing app combines World ID + GPS for reviews

### Indirect Competitors

2. **GPS requirement** - Impossible to fake at scale
3. **Foreigner-specific tags** - Tailored taxonomy no one else has
4. **Network effects** - More users = more reviews = more value
5. **Community trust** - Reputation compounds over time

## Trust Score: The Reputation Layer

### How It Works

Every user starts at **50** (neutral). Score moves based on community feedback.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Review marked "helpful" | +2 points |
| Review marked "not helpful" | -3 points |
| Review flagged & removed | -10 points |
| Consistent helpful reviews | Bonus multiplier |

### Display Tiers

| Score | Tier | Badge |
|-------|------|-------|
| 80-100 | Trusted Local | Green |
| 60-79 | Reliable | Blue |
| 40-59 | New | Gray |
| 20-39 | Low Trust | Orange |
| 0-19 | Untrusted | Red |

### Why This Matters

- **For readers**: Instantly know if reviewer is trustworthy
- **For writers**: Incentive to write helpful, accurate reviews
- **For platform**: Self-moderating community

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Launch (Hackathon)

1. **Seed content**: Team personally visits 20-30 spots in Jongno-gu, posts initial reviews
2. **Demo day**: Show working MVP to World Build judges

### Week 1-4: Soft Launch

1. **Reddit r/korea**: "We built an app for verified local reviews"
2. **Facebook Expats in Korea**: Targeted posts in groups
3. **Jongno-gu flyering**: QR codes at foreigner-heavy spots

### Month 2-3: Growth

1. **Influencer partnerships**: Expat YouTubers/Instagrammers
2. **Referral program**: Invite friends, both get Trust Score boost
3. **Business partnerships**: Foreigner-friendly businesses promote app

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Week 1 | Month 1 | Month 3 |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Verified users | 50 | 500 | 2,000 |
| Reviews posted | 100 | 1,000 | 5,000 |
| DAU | 20 | 100 | 500 |
| Trust Score avg | 50 | 52 | 55 |

## Post-Hackathon Roadmap

### Phase 1: Validate (Months 1-2)
- Launch in Jongno-gu
- Gather user feedback
- Iterate on tags and UX
- Hit 500 verified users

### Phase 2: Expand (Months 3-6)
- Add Hongdae, Gangnam areas
- Implement token rewards pilot
- Business verification program
- 2,000+ verified users

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 6-12)
- Full Seoul coverage
- Economic slashing mechanism
- In-app payments to merchants
- 10,000+ verified users

### Phase 4: Beyond Korea
- Japan (Tokyo expat areas)
- Taiwan (Taipei)
- Any region with:
  - High foreigner population
  - Language/culture barrier
  - World ID adoption

---

## Token Economics (Future Vision)

### Reward Mechanism

Helpful reviewers earn tokens:
- Review marked helpful = earn tokens
- Consistent high Trust Score = bonus rewards
- Early adopter multiplier

### Slashing Mechanism

Bad actors lose stake:
- Review flagged as false = lose tokens
- Pattern of unhelpful reviews = penalty
- Spam/abuse = account slashed

### Why This Works

Similar to prediction markets, economic incentives create better information signals:
- People with skin in the game are more careful
- False reviews become costly
- Truth becomes profitable

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Low World ID adoption in Korea | Partner with World Foundation for Korea push |
| GPS spoofing | Combine with World ID (hard to fake both) |
| Cold start (no reviews) | Seed content ourselves |
| Review quality | Trust Score + helpfulness voting |
| Competitor copies | First-mover + network effects + community |

---

## Why Now?

1. **World ID maturity**: 25M+ users, mini app ecosystem live
2. **Korea foreigner growth**: 2.5M and rising 10%/year
3. **Trust crisis in reviews**: People know reviews are fake
4. **No incumbent**: No one owns this niche

---

## Team

- **Solo developer**: Full-stack (Frontend + Backend + Product)

### Why I'll Win

- I understand the foreigner experience in Korea firsthand
- I can ship fast (12-24 hour hackathon proof)
- I believe in the World ID vision
