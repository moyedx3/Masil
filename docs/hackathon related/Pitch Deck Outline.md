# Masil - Pitch Deck Outline

**World Build Korea 2026**
**5 minutes | 6 slides**

---

## Slide 1: Problem

### Title: "Online reviews are broken"

### Content:
**One sentence:**
> "Foreigners in Korea can't trust online reviews - they're manipulated, in Korean, and written by people who were never there."

### Visual:
- Split screen: Fake 5-star reviews vs. real user frustration
- Stats if available: "X% of online reviews are fake"

### Speaking notes (30 sec):
- "Imagine you're exploring Insadong. You want to find a traditional restaurant that has an English menu."
- "Google reviews? Could be botted. Naver? All Korean."
- "You walk into 3 places, can't read the menu, leave awkwardly."
- "This is the daily reality for millions of foreigners visiting Seoul."

---

## Slide 2: Solution

### Title: "Masil - Reviews you can actually trust"

### Content:
**One sentence:**
> "GPS-verified reviews by World ID-verified humans, built for foreigners in Korea."

### Visual:
```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  World ID   │  +  │    GPS      │  =  │   Trust     │
│  (Human)    │     │  (Present)  │     │  (Reviews)  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

### Speaking notes (30 sec):
- "Masil combines two things no other platform has:"
- "World ID proves you're a real human - not a bot, not a fake account"
- "GPS proves you're actually there - not reviewing from your couch"
- "Together, they create the first review platform you can trust."

## Slide 3: Why World ID is Essential

### Title: "Without World ID, this doesn't work"

### Content:

| Without World ID | With World ID |
|------------------|---------------|
| Bots create thousands of fake reviews | One human = one account |
| Shop owners make fake positive reviews | Every reviewer is accountable |
| Competitors sabotage with fake negatives | Trust Score tracks reputation |
| No consequences for lying | Future: Economic slashing |

### Key point:
> "World ID isn't a nice-to-have login. It's the **core infrastructure** that makes trusted reviews possible."

### Speaking notes (45 sec):
- "Let me be clear: without World ID, Masil doesn't work."
- "GPS alone? Can be spoofed. Regular login? Create infinite accounts."
- "World ID's proof-of-personhood is the missing piece."
- "One Orb verification = one account. Period."
- "This isn't about convenience. It's about making trust possible."

## Slide 4: Demo

### Title: "See it in action"

### Content:
- **GIF or video** showing complete flow:
  1. Open app → World ID verification prompt
  2. Verify with World ID (Orb)
  3. See map of Jongno-gu with review pins
  4. Walk to a location (GPS indicator)
  5. Post a review with tags
  6. See review appear on map
  7. Vote on other reviews (helpful/not helpful)

### Speaking notes (60 sec):
- Walk through the demo live
- Highlight: "Notice I can only post because I'm verified AND at the location"
- Show Trust Score: "My score is 50 - I'm new. As I write helpful reviews, it goes up."

## Slide 5: Privacy & Anti-Abuse

### Title: "Privacy-first, abuse-resistant"

### Content:

**What we DON'T collect:**
- No real names
- No email addresses
- No personal information
- No tracking across apps

**What we DO store:**
- Nullifier hash (anonymous unique ID from World ID)
- Review content
- GPS coordinates (only when posting)

**Anti-abuse measures:**
| Attack | Defense |
|--------|---------|
| Bot reviews | World ID: one human = one account |
| Fake location | GPS: must be within 50m |
| Malicious reviews | Trust Score: reputation matters |
| Mass manipulation | Future: economic slashing |

### Speaking notes (45 sec):
- "Privacy is built in, not bolted on."
- "World ID uses zero-knowledge proofs - we verify you're human without knowing who you are."
- "We only store your nullifier hash - an anonymous ID that's unique to our app."
- "Combined with GPS verification, manipulation becomes impractical at scale."

## Slide 6: Go-to-Market & Future

### Title: "From Jongno-gu to the world"

### Content:

**Immediate (Post-hackathon):**
- Launch in Jongno-gu (Insadong, Bukchon area)
- Seed reviews from Google Maps foreigner reviews
- Reddit, Facebook expat groups, tourist forums

**3-6 months:**
- Expand to Hongdae, Gangnam
- 2,000+ verified users
- Token rewards pilot

**6-12 months:**
- Full Seoul coverage
- Economic slashing mechanism
- Merchant payment integration

**Beyond Korea:**
- Japan (Tokyo expat areas)
- Taiwan, Southeast Asia
- Any region with: foreigners + language barrier + World ID adoption

### Visual:
```
Jongno-gu → Seoul → Korea → Asia → Global
 (now)    (3mo)   (6mo)   (1yr)
```

### Speaking notes (30 sec):
- "We start small and focused: Jongno-gu - Seoul's historic heart, millions of foreign visitors yearly."
- "Seed with imported Google reviews, grow with verified users."
- "The playbook repeats anywhere foreigners struggle with local information."
- "Korea today. Japan tomorrow. Anywhere World ID goes, Masil can follow."

## Closing (if time permits)

### One-liner:
> "Masil: The first review platform where every review is written by a verified human who was actually there."

### Call to action:
> "We're looking for feedback, early users, and connections to the World Foundation team."

---

## Q&A Prep (2 minutes)

### Likely questions:

**Q: "Why not just use Google Maps?"**
> A: "No identity verification. Reviews can be botted. Not tailored for foreigners. We solve all three."

**Q: "Can't GPS be spoofed?"**
> A: "Yes, but combined with World ID, you'd need to spoof GPS AND have a unique World ID for each fake review. That doesn't scale."

**Q: "What about bad actors who are verified?"**
> A: "Trust Score creates reputation. Future slashing creates economic consequences. Bad behavior has a cost."

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
> A: "Phase 1: $1 view access for non-verified. Phase 2: Business promotions. Phase 3: Payment fees + token economics."

**Q: "Why Jongno-gu specifically?"**
> A: "Historic Seoul - Insadong, Bukchon, Gyeongbokgung. Millions of tourists, traditional spots with language barriers, and rich Google Maps data to seed from."

**Q: "Why Orb-only verification?"**
> A: "Strongest assurance. Device verification allows one person to have multiple devices = multiple accounts. Orb = truly one person, one account."

## Presentation Tips

1. **Start strong** - First 30 seconds must hook them
2. **Don't read slides** - Slides are visual, you tell the story
3. **Demo is key** - Even a simple working demo beats slides
4. **Time yourself** - Practice to stay under 5 minutes
5. **Anticipate questions** - Have crisp answers ready
6. **End with clarity** - They should remember: "GPS + World ID = trusted reviews for foreigners"
